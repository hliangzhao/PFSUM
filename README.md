## Learning-Augmented Algorithm for the Bahncard Problem

This repository contains the implementation code and results for the paper: Learning-Augmented Algorithm for the Bahncard Problem.

We compare PFSUM with SUM (TCS '01), PDLA (NeurIPS '20), SUMw (Section 4.1 of the paper), and FSUM (Section 4.2). To accommodate PDLA, we discretize time over a sufficiently long timespan, closely approximating a continuous time scenario. See the paper for details on the experimental setup.

The `figs` directory contains the figures we generated from the experimental results.
